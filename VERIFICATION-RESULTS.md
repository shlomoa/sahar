## 🎯 **System Architecture - DESIGNED & DOCUMENTED**

### **Direct Communication Model (Protocol v2.0):**
- 📺 **TV App**: WebSocket server + data receiver + YouTube player integration
- 📱 **Remote App**: WebSocket client + data owner + network discovery + enhanced controls
- 🔌 **Direct Communication**: Remote discovers TV and connects directly (no external server)

### **Data Flow - DESIGN COMPLETE**
```
1. TV Startup → WebSocket server starts on first available port (5544-5547)
2. Remote Startup → Network discovery scans for TV
3. Discovery → Remote finds TV and auto-connects
4. Data Transfer → Remote sends complete performers/videos/scenes data to TV
5. Navigation → Real-time command synchronization TV ↔ Remote
6. Video Control → Scene-based YouTube playback with enhanced controls
```
