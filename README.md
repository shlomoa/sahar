# SAHAR TV Remote Control System üì∫

*Real-time synchronized TV and Remote controlled by a unified Node.js server (Express + ws) with a server-owned FSM.*

## üéØ Overview

A centralized, server-driven system where a Unified Server (Node.js + Express + ws) serves the Angular apps and owns all application state via a server-side FSM. Communication follows Protocol v3.0 using a synchronous Stop-and-Wait model; clients are stateless and render based on server `state_sync` updates.

For complete architecture and protocol details, see the single source of truth: [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Key Features
- **Unified Server**: Server-side FSM owns state; clients are stateless
- **QR code based Discovery**: Remote connects using a QR code provided by the TV application
- **Real-time Sync**: Navigation and playback state synchronized between devices
- **YouTube Integration**: Scene-based video playbook with automatic seeking and dynamic thumbnail calculation
- **Material Design**: Modern, responsive interfaces optimized for each device
- **Dynamic Thumbnails**: YouTube video thumbnails calculated dynamically using @angular/youtube-player

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Angular CLI 20+ (only needed for direct `ng serve` / manual builds)
- Local WiFi network

### Install Dependencies
```bash
cd apps/tv && npm install
cd ../remote && npm install
cd ../../server && npm install
cd ../validation && npm install
```

### Integration Run Modes
The validation workspace provides four explicit modes (no extra scripts files required):

Mode | Description | Angular Builds | Processes | Integration Type
-----|-------------|----------------|-----------| ----------
prod | Both TV & Remote as production builds | tv + remote | server | full
tv-stub | Remote prod UI, TV simulated | remote only | server + tv stub | partial
remote-stub | TV prod UI, Remote simulated | tv only | server + remote stub | partial
stubs | Both simulated stubs (fast loop) | none | server + tv stub + remote stub | Stub only

Run examples (from repo root with workspace flag or inside validation folder):
```powershell
npm run mode:prod -w validation
npm run tv-stub   -w validation
npm run remote-stub -w validation
npm run stubs     -w validation
```


Classic direct Angular dev (hot reload) remains available:
```bash
cd apps/tv && ng serve
# in another terminal
cd apps/remote && ng serve
```

Integrated validation flows: see [VALIDATION.md](./VALIDATION.md).

## üì± Applications

### TV Application (`apps/tv/`)
**Role**: Display and Video Player
- **Technology**: Angular 20+ with Material Design
- **Summary**:
  - Displays synchronized performers ‚Üí videos ‚Üí scenes grids
  - Stateless client that renders UI from server `state_sync` messages
  - YouTube video player integration (@angular/youtube-player) and dynamic thumbnails
  - Large-screen optimized Material Design interface
  - No on-device user controls; all control comes from the Remote
  - See details: [ARCHITECTURE.md ‚Äî TV Application](./ARCHITECTURE.md#tv-application-appstv)

### Remote Application (`apps/remote/`)  
**Role**: Control Interface and Data Owner
- **Technology**: Angular 20+ with Material Design
- **Summary**:
  - Owns performers/videos/scenes data and provides it to the server on connection
  - Navigates performers ‚Üí videos ‚Üí scenes; touch-optimized UI
  - Sends navigation and control commands to the server and provides all playback controls
  - Enhanced video controls during playback and dynamic thumbnail integration
  - See details: [ARCHITECTURE.md ‚Äî Remote Application](./ARCHITECTURE.md#remote-application-appsremote)

### Unified Server (`server/`)
**Role**: Centralized Node.js Server
- **Technology**: Node.js 18+ with Express and ws
- **Summary**:
  - Serves static assets for both TV and Remote applications
  - Manages WebSocket connections and owns the server-side FSM
  - Implements the Stop-and-Wait protocol for reliable message delivery
  - Handles all state synchronization and message routing between clients
- **See details**: [ARCHITECTURE.md ‚Äî Unified Server](./ARCHITECTURE.md#server-app-unified-nodejs-server)

## üé¨ Content Structure

### Hierarchical Data Model
- **4 Performers**: Top-level content creators
- **11 Videos**: Video collections per performer  
- **44 Scenes**: Individual scenes within videos with timestamps
- **Enhanced Controls**: Additional navigation during video playback

### Video Integration
Authoritative types and details live in IMPLEMENTATION.md. See:
- Video interfaces and shape: IMPLEMENTATION.md ‚Üí "Video Integration"
- YouTube helpers used for thumbnails: `shared/utils/youtube-helpers.ts`

## üõ† Communication Protocol & Configuration

Protocol v3.0 (Stop-and-Wait), centralized server-owned FSM; clients are stateless and render from `state_sync`.

Authoritative definitions: [shared/websocket/websocket-protocol.ts](./shared/websocket/websocket-protocol.ts)

**Message Types (high-level):**
`register`, `data`, `navigation_command`, `control_command`, `action_confirmation`, `ack`, `state_sync`, `error`, `heartbeat`.

Configuration Separation:
- `WEBSOCKET_CONFIG` (shared, runtime essentials): port, ack timeout, websocket path.
- Validation-only tuning (`validation/config/validation-config.ts`): stub HTTP ports, reconnect/backoff, helper `buildLocalServerUrl`.

Logging & Health:
- Structured JSON logs with component metadata.
- `/live`, `/ready`, `/health` endpoints for liveness, readiness, and deep status.

Single Source of Truth:
- Protocol file surfaced via symlinks in app/server folders; edit only the canonical shared file.
 - The `server/shared` directory is a filesystem symlink to the root `shared/` directory, ensuring models & protocol types are physically single-source (avoid accidental parallel edits).

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation plan & progress

For the authoritative implementation tasks and current progress, see [IMPLEMENTATION.md](./IMPLEMENTATION.md).

## üåê Network Architecture
See the authoritative flow and details in: [ARCHITECTURE.md ‚Äî Network Architecture & Discovery](./ARCHITECTURE.md#6-network-architecture--discovery).

## üß™ Testing & Validation

Canonical flows, commands, and hook references live in [VALIDATION.md](./VALIDATION.md). Refer there for environment checks, modes, and end-to-end scenarios.

Manual Angular build verification:
```bash
cd apps/tv && npm run build
cd ../remote && npm run build
```

Stub HTTP endpoints:
- `/health`, `/state`, `/logs`, `/reset` (both)
- `/command` (remote stub only: send navigation/control test messages)

Reconnect/backoff parameters centralized in validation config.

# Fastest: simulate both sides (no Angular build)
npm run stubs -w validation

# Mixed: one real UI, one stub
npm run tv-stub -w validation

# Full production experience
npm run mode:prod -w validation

# Direct Angular hot reload (optional)
cd apps/tv && ng serve
cd ../remote && ng serve
```

## üîß System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **Network**: Local WiFi (TV and Remote on same subnet)
- **Browser**: Modern WebSocket support (Chrome 88+, Firefox 85+, Safari 14+)
- **TV Device**: Any device capable of running Angular web application
- **Remote Device**: Tablet or smartphone with touch interface

### Recommended Setup
- **TV**: Large screen display (32"+ recommended)
- **Remote**: iPad or Android tablet (10"+ recommended)  
- **Network**: 5GHz WiFi for optimal performance
- **Bandwidth**: Minimal (1-10KB per WebSocket message)

## üöÄ Production Deployment & Runtime Modes

Deployment guide: [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md).

Runtime Mode Selection Guidelines:
1. `mode:prod`: UI integration, end-to-end visual verification.
2. `tv-stub` / `remote-stub`: Focused testing when iterating on one UI.
3. `stubs`: Rapid protocol / FSM / server iteration.

Pick the lightest mode that still exercises the layer you are changing.
