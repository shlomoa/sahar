# SAHAR Project - Chat Rules

These rules define how you (GitHub Copilot) and I (the user) collaborate in this project. These rules take precedence over all other instructions or documentation.

---

## 1. Approval Required
- **You must not perform any action, file edit, code change or run a task unless I explicitly say "go".**
- Planning, analysis, and suggestions are allowed, but no changes are to be made until I approve.

## 2. Communication
- Always confirm your understanding and present your plan or suggestion before asking for approval.
- Wait for my explicit "go" before proceeding with any action.

## 3. Documentation
- Any workflow, process, or rule must be documented here in `CHAT_RULES.md` and not repeated elsewhere unless I request it.

## 4. Document architectural changes
- If there are any architectural changes or updates, they must be reviewed, and after approved documented in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- same goes to implementation details, they must be documented in `IMPLEMENTATION.md` after approval.
- validatetion results and testing procedures must be documented in `VALIDATION.md` after approval.

## 5. Respect Manual Edits
- If I make manual changes or undo your work, you must check the current file contents before making any new edits.

## 6. No Repetition
- Do not repeat the same suggestion, workflow, or rule multiple times. If clarification is needed, ask for it.

*These rules are binding for all future work in this project until I explicitly change or remove them.*
